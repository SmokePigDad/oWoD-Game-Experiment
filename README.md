# AI World of Darkness Experiment with Roo Code

This repository is the central hub for running interactive, AI-driven World of Darkness chronicles using Roo Code. It contains all AI mode instructions, sheet templates, and the client logic for a fully interactive, choice-driven immersive tabletop experience‚Äînow powered by authentic, server-side WoD rules.

## üåô What's New!

- **Total World of Darkness Overhaul**: Supports Vampire: the Masquerade, Werewolf, Mage, Changeling, Wraith, and Mummy with native tools for all supernatural types (pre-Time of Judgment setting).
- **Narrative Choice Engine**: Uses the new "Describe ‚Üí Ask ‚Üí Resolve" method‚ÄîAI sets the scene, presents you with choices, and transparently resolves your actions using backend servers for fairness and surprise. Every player action is YOUR choice.
- **Interactive Character Creation**: No more single-prompt characters. The AI walks you step-by-step through point-buy for attributes, abilities, powers, backgrounds, and everything else, enforcing all WoD rules server-side.
- **Graphical HTML Character Sheets & Visual Health**: Instantly generate stunning, sourcebook-style HTML sheets and visual health trackers straight from your in-game data.
- **True XP & Progression Menu**: Spend experience points interactively with real-time cost checks (attributes, virtues, disciplines, willpower, more). No cheating, no math slip-ups!
- **Dynamic Status & Feedback**: All health, damage, and resource spending (blood, rage, gnosis, etc.) resolved with visual feedback and proper checks.
- **Server-Enforced Integrity**: All game mechanics happen server-side‚Äîno client fudge, all changes are validated.
- **Full Crossover Capability**: Play with and against any combo of WoD splats in the same chronicle.

## üïØÔ∏è The AI Storyteller Loop

This project is built on a "Describe ‚Üí Ask ‚Üí Resolve" gameplay cycle:
1. **Describe**: The AI sets the scene based on world and character history.
2. **Ask**: You are presented with 3-5 meaningful choices‚Äîalways in your character's voice.
3. **Resolve**: Once you choose, the AI calls backend tools (`perform_roll`, `resolve_attack`, etc.) and narrates the consequences faithfully.

_All behind-the-scenes dice, power effects, XP costs, and wounds are resolved through powerful MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers, guaranteeing system integrity and drama at every action._

**Example:**
```
AI: The Tremere Regent narrows her eyes. "Are you loyal to the Camarilla, neonate?"
1. Lie convincingly (Manipulation + Subterfuge)
2. Assert your position‚Äîdemand respect (Charisma + Leadership)
3. Subtly threaten with your supernatural Presence
4. Remain silent and let her judge
```
You choose, and the AI resolves everything with correct rolls and effects.

## üß© Repository Structure

- **`.roomodes`**: Defines the üíÄ WoD Storyteller (Interactive) mode, including AI instructions, permissions, and workflow.
- **`character-sheet-wod-template.md`**: The core character notes template, with WoD-style "dot" ratings and health levels.
- **`wod-quickstart-guide.md`**: Quick guide to system rules and interactive play.
- **`campaigns/`**: Where all campaign and character files are auto-generated by the system (not version-controlled by default).

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Set up the [Unified WoD MCP Servers](https://github.com/SmokePigDad/rpg-mcp-servers)**:
   - Clone, install, and run `game-state-server` and `combat-engine-server`.
   - These provide all dice, sheet, XP, magic, and combat automation‚Äîno local dice, no fudge.

2. **Configure Roo Code:**
   - Connect both MCP servers in your `mcp_settings.json`.
   - Open this folder as your Visual Studio Code workspace root. Roo Code recognizes the `storyteller-wod` mode automatically.

3. **Play a Chronicle:**
   - Activate the üíÄ WoD Storyteller (Interactive) mode in Roo Code.
   - Ask the AI to start character creation, or dive into the story and face your first dilemma.
   - Use the "generate a fancy character sheet" or "show my health" features at any time‚Äîit's all live and visual.

## ‚ö° Key Innovations

- **Always Player-Led**: The AI NEVER chooses your actions‚Äîevery dramatic beat is an explicit player choice.
- **Full Rules-Binding**: No handwaving XP, wounds, or supernatural effects. All are validated on the server, using actual WoD rules.
- **Visual Immersion**: Instantly create sourcebook-style HTML sheets and health summaries after key events.
- **PC/NPC Parity**: All characters‚Äîplayer or nonplayer‚Äîare built, tracked, and held to the same rigorous story and mechanical standards.

## ‚ú® Example Interactive Features

- **Choice-Based Scenes**: Every major action is a player-presented choice‚Äîno railroading.
- **Combat Resolution**: All mechanics happen under the hood; just narrate your tactic and watch the server determine the outcome.
- **Experience Menus**: Use XP exactly as you would with a live ST, but free from math errors.
- **Campaign Logs & Journals**: AI will update story journals and campaign notes as actions unfold.

**Start your own gothic-punk epic‚Äîwhere every choice has weight, every power is real, and the Storyteller System finally lives up to its name.**
